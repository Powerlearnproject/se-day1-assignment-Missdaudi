#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is simply  the art of building software that works well and solves problems.
Importance
Helps in problem solving, Software engineering helps in innovation of technologies like AI. designing and building complex systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering has evolved a lot over the years. It started in 1960s when people realized that building software needed more structure and planning. Then, in the 1970s and 1980s, the Waterfall model came along, whereby development followed clear steps like planning, designing, and testing. However, it's disadvantage is it wasn’t very flexible if things changed mid-project. In the 2000s, Agile evolved, offering a more flexible approach. These changes have helped software engineering become more organized, adaptable, and responsive to what people actually need.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: finding out what the software needs to do, how long it will take, and what resources are needed—kind of like making a plan before starting a project.

Requirements Gathering: Talking to the people who will use the software to understand exactly what they want and need from it.

Design: Planning out how the software will work.

Coding: This is where the actual building happens. writing the codes
Testing: After building the software, you test it to make sure everything works right and fix any problems.
Deployment: Once everything is working well, the software is launched and made available for users to start using.

Maintenance: After the software is out there, you keep it updated, fix any issues that come up, and make improvements based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a linear and fixed sequence while agile Works in small, flexible cycles called sprints
Agile allows changes to be made at any time, even in the middle of development while waterfall is less flexible
Waterfall is best for projects where the requirements are clear and won’t change for example, building software for an existing system with fixed needs, like an internal accounting system while agile is best for projects that require constant feedback and adaptation for example, developing a mobile app where user feedback and market trends can quickly change what’s needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are the ones who write the code and build the software, turning ideas into real features. They fix any bugs and make sure everything works smoothly. 
The Quality Assurance (QA) engineers come in to test the software, checking for bugs and making sure everything functions as it should. If they find any problems, they report them so developers can fix them.
Project Manager keeps the whole team organized, making sure the project stays on track, on time, and within budget. They plan the work, set deadlines, and solve problems that come up during the process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is like a workspace for developers, bringing everything they need to write, test, and debug code into one place. It helps by suggesting code, highlighting errors as they type, and allowing them to test their work right within the same tool. Eg the Visual Studio Code 
Version Control System like Git helps developers track changes made to the code, so they can work together without overwriting each other's work. It keeps a history of all changes, making it easy to go back to an earlier version if something goes wrong.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Dealing with complex problems, maintaining code quality, and managing tight deadlines. 
breaking down difficult issues into manageable tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Writing clean, modular code and conducting regular code reviews can help maintain quality over time.
Communication can be a challenge, especially when explaining technical details to non-technical people, so clear and concise communication is key

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: This is about testing the smallest parts of the software to make sure they work correctly.It helps catch small bugs early and makes future changes easier.
Integration Testing: After the individual parts are tested, integration testing checks if different parts of the system work together. Even if each part works on its own, problems can happen when they interact, so this test ensures everything flows smoothly when combined.
System Testing: This type tests the entire software as a whole to make sure it meets all the requirements. 
Acceptance Testing: This is the final check before the software is released. It's usually done by the customer or product owner to make sure the software does what it’s supposed to do and meets their needs and expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing the right questions or instructions to give to an AI model (like GPT) in order to get the best possible answer. 
 Helps Get Accurate Answers
 Encourages Creativity
 Makes Communication with AI Easier

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about climate change."
mproved Prompt: "Can you explain the main causes of climate change and how it affects the environment?"

Improved Prompt Works Better because its
More Focused: The vague prompt could lead to a broad explanation that touches on anything related to climate change. The improved prompt narrows it down to causes and environmental effects, making it more focused.

Clearer: The new prompt clearly asks for two specific aspects—what causes climate change and how it impacts the environment. This makes it easier for the AI to provide a structured, relevant answer.
